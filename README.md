# EvenlyCodingChallenge

## Disclaimer:

2 of the 3 main goals were achieved (the canonical link sharing feature is missing)<br />
no tests were added, although they are as important as the code itself 
due to time constraints, the focus has been more on the technical aspect 

For usage and testing please put your own Foursquare API key into your local.properties file. 

## Used technologies:

* WorkManager API<br />
* MVVM architecture including Room Library<br />
* Kotlin Flows and Coroutines<br />
* Dependency injection with Dagger Hilt<br />
* Retrofit/OkHttp<br />
* Navigation components<br />

## Things to improve:

* Implement canonical link sharing feature<br />
* Add unit, ui and end to end tests<br />
* No hard coded resources (colors, margins...) and strings<br />
* Make database tables relational<br />
* Use data binding<br />
* Use pagination and paging for recyclerview<br />
* Use data store or shared preferences<br />
* Add splash screen and use images<br />
* Add more features<br />
