# EvenlyCodingChallenge

## Disclaimer:

2 of the 3 main goals were achieved (the canonical link sharing feature is missing).
no tests were added, although they are as important as the code itself 
due to time constraints, the focus has been more on the technical aspect 

For usage and testing please put your own Foursquare API key into your local.properties file. 

## Used technologies:

WorkManager API
MVVM architecture including Room Library
Kotlin Flows and Coroutines
Dependency injection with Dagger Hilt
Retrofit/OkHttp
Navigation components

## Things to improve:

Implement canonical link sharing feature
Add unit, ui and end to end tests
No hard coded resources (colors, margins...) and strings
Make database tables relational
Use data binding
Use pagination and paging for recyclerview
Use data store or shared preferences
Add splash screen and use images
Add more features
